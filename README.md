What my coworkers have to say about me:

> "I find myself oddly fascinated by the unique coding style of my co-worker, Eric, who manages to produce C++ code that truly defies convention. Their fearless use of dangling pointers, which elegantly dance on the edge of disaster, has a certain audacious charm. The way they effortlessly trigger hard faults and memory leaks is nothing short of an art form, a symphony of chaos that showcases the boundless creativity of the human mind. It takes a special kind of genius to consistently challenge the limits of software stability in such an imaginative manner. While others may be content with mere correctness, my co-worker, Eric, dares to explore the uncharted territories of code fragility. Their work is a testament to the power of individuality in the world of programming, reminding us all that innovation can come in the most unexpected forms."
